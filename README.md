## Website  
The NFLSimulatoR package website is hosted at [https://datacolorado.com/r/NFLSimulatoR](https://datacolorado.com/r/NFLSimulatoR/).

### Overview
The intent of NFLSimulatoR (version 0.1.0) is to enable the simulation of plays/drives and evaluate game-play strategies in the National Football League (NFL). Built-in strategies include going for it on fourth down and varying the proportion of passing/rushing plays during a drive. The user should be familiar with nflscrapR data before trying to write his/her own strategies. The package itself is inspired by a 
[blog post by Mike Lopez](https://statsbylopez.netlify.app/post/resampling-nfl-drives/), currently the Director of Data and Analytics at the NFL.
