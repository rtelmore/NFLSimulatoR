Description: The intent here is to enable the simulation of plays/drives and
    evaluate game-play strategies in the National Football League (NFL).
    Built-in strategies include going for it on fourth down and varying the 
    proportion of passing/rushing plays during a drive. The user should be
    familiar with nflscrapR data before trying to write his/her own 
    strategies. This work is inspired by a blog post by Mike Lopez, 
    currently the  Director of Data and Analytics at the NFL, Lopez (2019) <https://statsbylopez.netlify.app/post/resampling-nfl-drives/>.
